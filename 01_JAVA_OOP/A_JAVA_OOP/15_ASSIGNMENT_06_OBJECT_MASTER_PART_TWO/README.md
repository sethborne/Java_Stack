## Object Master: Part Two

The club liked your work so much that they asked you to build out their character choices a bit more. They want you to add Ninja, Wizard, and Samurai classes, but they also want any modifications they make to the Human class to extend to these.

In addition to that, each class will have some unique features:

The Wizard class should have a default health of 50 and intelligence of 8; a method called heal that heals whoever it was casted on by the wizard's intelligence; and a method called fireball that decrease the health of whichever object it attacked by 3 * the wizards intelligence.

The Ninja class should have a default stealth of 10; a method, steal, that takes health from another human by their stealth level; and a way to run away that will decrease their health by 10.

The Samurai class should have a default health of 200; a method called deathBlow that attacks an object and decreases its health to 0, but also halves the Samurai's health; a method called meditate which heals the Samurai back to full health; and a method called howMany that returns the current number of Samurai.

Once you are done with this, they would like to see a sample test of the various classes interacting.
