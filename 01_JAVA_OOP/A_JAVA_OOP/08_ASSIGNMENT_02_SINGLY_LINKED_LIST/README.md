Singly Linked List
In this assignment, you will create your own implementation of a singly linked list.

# Topics:

● Java classes and objects

● Singly Linded list

# Tasks:

~~● Create a Node class with the value and next attributes~~

~~● Create a constructor method that sets the value to a given number and next to null of your Node objects~~

~~● Create a SinglyLinkedList class with the head attribute~~

~~● Create a constructor method that sets the head to null of your SinglyLinkedList objects~~

~~● Create a add(int) method that will add a node to the end of your list with the value in the parameter~~

~~● Create a remove() method that will remove a node from the end of your list~~

~~● Create printValues() method that will print all the values of each node in the list in order~~

~~● Create a ListTester class to test your methods~~

# Optional Challenges:

● Implement a find(int) method that will return the first node with the value in the parameter

● Implement a removeAt(int) method that will remove the node after n nodes, where n is the parameter
