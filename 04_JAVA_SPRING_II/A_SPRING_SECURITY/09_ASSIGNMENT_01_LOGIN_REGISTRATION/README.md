# Assignment: Login and Registration

You need to build a login page for users to get to a dashboard. Make sure they only use real email addresses, have a first and last name, and have matching passswords that are at least 10 characters long. Once the user has logged in, show them their dashboard with their information and the ability to logout; also don't let anyone get to the dashboard page if they are not logged in - just send them back to the home page.
